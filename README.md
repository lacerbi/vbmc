# Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC)

VBMC is an approximate inference method designed to fit and evaluate computational models with a limited budget of potentially noisy likelihood evaluations (e.g., for computationally expensive models).

**>>> The official repository for VBMC has moved to my lab's GitHub page: [https://github.com/acerbilab/vbmc](https://github.com/acerbilab/vbmc).**
